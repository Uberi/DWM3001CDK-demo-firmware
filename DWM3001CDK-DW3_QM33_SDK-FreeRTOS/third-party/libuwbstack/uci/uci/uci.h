/**
 * DOC: Overview
 *
 * The UCI core implements packets parsing, packets generation, error
 * processing, segmentation, reassembly and routing. It can be used to implement
 * a UCI server (which receives commands) or UCI client (which receives
 * responses and notifications).
 *
 * The packets are sent and received using a transport channel which is
 * responsible for framing, and communication with the transport driver.
 *
 * Received commands are given to message handlers which decode the payload.
 */

/**
 * DOC: Memory handling
 *
 * To allow zero copy, buffers used to store packet data are allocated
 * dynamically. This can be backed with simple heap allocation, or using
 * a limited pool of memory blocks.
 *
 * To limit memory fragmentation, packet buffers can be split in smaller
 * blocks. This is decided by the memory allocator. In this case, a packet can
 * be composed of several blocks which are chained together. The first block
 * contains the information of the full packet length.
 */

 * UCI_BLK_SIZE_MIN - Minimal size of a buffer block.
 *
 * The minimal size of a block is 20 bytes. This is needed for segmentation of
 * a block over several UCI packets, 4 bytes for the header, and 16 bytes for
 * a block descriptor.
 *
 * This minimal size ought to be respected by allocator
